**Orange Cake Recipe**

This classic orange cake recipe is a delightful treat that combines the flavors of fresh oranges, nuts, and spices. The result is a moist and flavorful cake that's perfect for special occasions or everyday snacks.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 1/2 cups sugar
* 1 cup fresh orange juice
* 2 tablespoons grated orange peel
* 1 cup water
* 1 cup chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans work well)
* 1 cup butter, softened
* 1 cup chopped dates
* 4 cups sifted flour
* 2 tablespoons grated orange peel
* 4 large eggs
* 1/3 cup buttermilk
* 1 teaspoon baking soda

**Directions:**

1. Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C). Grease a large tube pan and set it aside.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, orange peel, and baking soda.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, melted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract.
4. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.
5. Fold in the chopped nuts and dates.
6. Pour the batter into the prepared tube pan and smooth out the top.
7. Bake for 1 1/2 hours, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.

**Tips and Variations:**

* To prevent the cake from browning too quickly, cover it with foil during the last half-hour of baking.
* If you prefer a stronger orange flavor, use freshly squeezed orange juice and add some grated orange zest to the batter.
* Consider adding a handful of chocolate chips or chopped candy pieces to make the cake even more special.

**Suggested Variations:**

* **Boiled Frosting:** Mix 1 cup powdered sugar with 2 tablespoons milk and boil it in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract.
* **Glazed Cake:** Drizzle the boiled frosting over the warm cake while it's still in the pan.

I hope you enjoy making and devouring this delicious orange cake!
