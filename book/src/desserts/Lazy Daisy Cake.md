**Ingredients:**

* 1 1/4 cups boiling water

* 1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 eggs
* 1 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 3/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1/4 cup chopped nuts (optional)
* 3/4 cup shredded or flaked coconut (optional)

**Directions:**

1. **Prepare the oats mixture:** Pour boiling water over the oats and let it stand for 20 minutes. Cover with a lid to prevent water loss.
2. **Cream the butter:** Beat the softened butter until creamy, about 3 minutes. Gradually add the eggs, beating well after each addition.
3. **Stir in oats and spices:** Stir in the prepared oats mixture, then sift together the flour, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
4. **Add sugar mixtures:** Add the creamed mixture to the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined.
5. **Pour into pan:** Pour the batter into a greased and floured 9-inch square pan.
6. **Bake:** Bake in a preheated oven at 325°F (165°C) for 50-55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
7. **Prepare frosting:** Combine all the ingredients for the frosting, spread over the cake while it's still hot.

**Tips and Variations:**

* Use canned milk instead of half-and-half for an extra-rich frosting.
* Add chopped nuts or shredded coconut on top of the cake before baking for added texture and flavor.
* Try using different types of sugar or spices to create a unique flavor profile.
