**German's Sweet Chocolate Cake**
=====================================

**Introduction**

This classic Southern dessert is a staple of American baking, and for good reason - its rich, velvety chocolate cake paired with a sweet coconut-pecan filling and frosting is a match made in heaven. With its moist crumb and subtle flavor nuances, German's Sweet Chocolate Cake is sure to become a favorite among friends and family alike.

**Ingredients**

* 1 pkg (4 oz) Baker's German's Sweet Baking Chocolate
* 1/2 cup water
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
* 2 egg yolks
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 cup buttermilk
* 4 large egg whites

**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
2. Line the bottoms of three 9-inch round cake pans with wax paper.
3. Microwave the chocolate and water in a large microwavable bowl on high for 1-1/2 to 2 minutes, or until the chocolate is almost melted. Stir halfway through heating time, then stir until the chocolate is completely melted.
4. Mix the flour, baking soda, and salt together; set aside.
5. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy.
6. Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition.
7. Stir in the chocolate mixture and vanilla extract.
8. Add the flour mixture alternately with buttermilk, beating after each addition until smooth.
9. Beat the egg whites in another large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form. Gently stir into the batter.
10. Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
11. Immediately run a spatula between the cakes and sides of the pans to loosen them.
12. Cool the cakes for 15 minutes before removing them from the pans. Remove the wax paper and cool completely on wire racks.

**Suggested Variations or Adjustments**

* For an extra-moist cake, try adding an additional tablespoon or two of buttermilk to the batter.
* To add a fun twist, substitute the coconut-pecan filling with chopped nuts like almonds or walnuts.
* Experiment with different types of chocolate chips or chunks for a unique flavor profile.
