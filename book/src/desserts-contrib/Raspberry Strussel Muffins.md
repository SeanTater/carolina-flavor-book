**Raspberry Streusel Muffins**

A delicious and nostalgic recipe that brings back memories of picking wild raspberries as a child. These muffins are perfect for a weekend morning treat, paired with a cup of tea or coffee.

**Ingredients:**
* 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1 egg
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 6 tablespoons cold butter or margarine (for streusel topping)
* 1/2 cup fresh or frozen raspberries
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 3 tablespoons granulated sugar (for streusel topping)

**Directions:**

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
2. In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg.
3. In a separate bowl, mix together the sour cream, milk, and vanilla extract.
4. Combine the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and baking soda) and stir into the creamed mixture alternately with the sour cream mixture, just until moistened.
5. Gently fold in the raspberries.
6. Fill the muffin cups two-thirds full with the batter.
7. To make the streusel topping: combine the flour, oats, sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl. Mix well. Cut in the cold butter until crumbly.
8. Sprinkle the streusel topping evenly over the muffins.
9. Bake for 18-22 minutes or until the muffins test done. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.

**Tips and Variations:**

* Use fresh raspberries instead of frozen for the best flavor and texture.
* Substitute other types of berries, such as blueberries or blackberries, for a different twist.
* Add a handful of chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans) to the streusel topping for added crunch.
* Try using brown sugar or honey instead of granulated sugar for a richer flavor.
