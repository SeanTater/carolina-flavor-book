# Apple Pan Dowdy: A Delicious Twist on Classic Apple Pies

Are you looking for a new dessert to impress your friends and family? Look no further than Apple Pan Dowdy, a delightful twist on traditional apple pies. This recipe features tender apples wrapped in a flaky pastry crust, topped with a crunchy brown sugar topping that's sure to become a favorite.

## Ingredients:

* 1 quart cooked apples (about 4-5 medium-sized apples)
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon vinegar
* 1/4 cup water
* 1 pinch salt
* Pie dough (homemade or store-bought)

## Directions:

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked apples, flour, brown sugar, vinegar, and water. Mix until well combined.
2. Cook the apple mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it thickens into a paste-like consistency. This should take about 10-15 minutes.
3. Add a little butter (about 1 tablespoon) and vanilla extract to the apple mixture. Stir until fully incorporated.
4. Roll out the pie dough to a thickness of about 1/8 inch. Place the apple mixture onto one half of the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
5. Fold the other half of the dough over the apples, pressing the edges together to seal the pan dowdy. Use a knife or pastry brush to create a decorative edge.
6. Brush the top of the pan dowdy with a little milk or beaten egg for a golden glaze.
7. Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 25-30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the apples are bubbly.

## Suggested Variations:

* Add a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg to the apple mixture for an extra boost of flavor.
* Use a combination of sugar and honey instead of brown sugar for a richer flavor.
* Experiment with different types of vinegar, such as apple cider or balsamic, for a unique twist.
* Top the pan dowdy with chopped nuts or shredded coconut for added texture and flavor.
