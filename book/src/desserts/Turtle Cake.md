**Ingredients:**

* 1 box German chocolate cake mix
* 3 eggs
* 1.5 sticks oleo (butter)
* 1 cup water
* 14 ounces caramels
* 1/3 cup evaporated milk
* 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
* 1/2 cup chopped nuts

**Directions:**

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease a 13x9-inch pan and set it aside.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cake mix, eggs, oleo, and water. Blend until smooth.
3. Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 15 minutes.
4. While the cake is baking, melt the caramels in a saucepan over low heat. Stir in the evaporated milk.
5. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Drizzle the caramel mixture over the top of the cake.
6. Sprinkle the chocolate chips over the caramel layer, followed by the chopped nuts.
7. Pour on the remaining batter and smooth out the top.
8. Bake for an additional 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

**Variations:**

* Add a sprinkle of sea salt on top of the cake before baking for a touch of savory flavor.
* Use chopped pecans instead of walnuts for a different texture and flavor combination.
* Try using different types of chocolate chips, such as milk chocolate or white chocolate, for a unique twist.
