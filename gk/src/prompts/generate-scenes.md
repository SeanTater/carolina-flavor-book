## Example: A close up on the food
"A close-up of a pepperoni pizza, topped with whole basil leaves and slices of mushroom, and having a thick, toasted crust. Whisps of steam lift off the toppings in a dim beam of light. The cheese between the slices of pepperoni is golden brown, with parts slightly charred from the oven. A few bits of onion poke through the layer of cheese"

## Example: Context to provide a fun scene
"An older heavy-set man and his wife sit down at a table behind a warm pepperoni pizza with whole basil leaves, sitting on a pizza peel. Two slices are taken out and sitting on their plates. A cat standing on a counter in the background eyes the pizza as well. There is a strong depth of field focused on the pizza; the man, wife, cat and dogs are all out of focus."
