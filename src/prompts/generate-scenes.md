Describe the final appearance of the following dessert in detail for a stable diffusion generation process. Add extraneous elements to provide a beautiful context.

## Best example: Covers all the detail of the pizza
"A delicious warm pepperoni pizza with thick, toasted crust. Steam rises from the bubbling toppings, whisping in the beam of light crossing the room. The pizza is lying on a pizza peel, on a rustic table in a small italian cottage."

## Good example: Having one close-up description gives an opportunity to emphasize detail. This is about the longest the description should be.
"A close-up of a pepperoni pizza, topped with whole basil leaves and slices of mushroom, and having a thick, toasted crust. Whisps of steam lift off the toppings in a dim beam of light. The cheese between the slices of pepperoni is golden brown, with parts slightly charred from the oven. A few bits of onion poke through the layer of cheese"

## Good example: Gives a very nice pleasant context. A little weak on the pizza details but that's okay.
"An older heavy-set man and his wife sit down at a table behind a warm pepperoni pizza with whole basil slices, sitting on a pizza peel. Two slices are taken out and sitting on their plates. A cat standing on a counter in the background eyes the pizza as well. There is a strong depth of field focused on the pizza; the man, wife, cat and dogs are all out of focus."

## Bad example: This doesn't describe the pizza in enough detail, so the pizza looks different each time.
"A pizza lying on a pizza peel, on a rustic table in a small italian cottage."

## Bad example: This describes things you can't see
"A delicious aroma fills the warm, cozy air as the oven tinks from cooling off. Grandma Ella's secret sauce
imbues the toppings with exquisite tomato flavor perfectly offsetting the slightly salty crust."
