**Autumn Delight: Apple Dumplings**
=====================================

As the leaves change and the air grows crisp, it's time to cozy up with a warm and comforting dessert. Apple dumplings are a classic treat that combines the sweetness of apples with the flaky goodness of pastry. This recipe is a perfect way to enjoy the flavors of autumn in a single, delightful package.

**Ingredients**
---------------

* 2 cups sifted flour
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 3/4 cup shortening (cold and cut into small pieces)
* 6-8 tablespoons ice water
* 6 medium-sized apples
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 2 cups water

**Directions**
-------------

### Make the Pastry Dough

1. Sift flour and salt directly into a mixing bowl.
2. Add most of the shortening and cut it in with a pastry blender or 2 knives until the mixture resembles "meal".
3. Then add remaining shortening and cut it into pieces about the size of giant peas.
4. Sprinkle water lightly, blending it in with a fork until the dough can be just pressed together into a ball.
5. Roll out the dough into 1/8 inch thick on a lightly floured cloth-covered board.
6. Cut into 7-inch squares.

### Assemble and Bake the Dumplings

1. Peel and core the apples and place an apple on each pastry square.
2. Fill the cavity of each apple with the sugar and cinnamon mixture, dot with butter.
3. Moisten the points of the pastry square and bring opposite points up over the apple, overlapping them to seal well.
4. Place about 2 inches apart in a baking pan (8 x 12 inches).
5. Chill thoroughly.

### Make the Syrup

1. Mix together sugar, cinnamon, butter, and water in a saucepan.
2. Boil for 3 minutes.
3. Pour the hot syrup around the chilled dumplings in the baking pan.
4. Bake immediately for 5-7 minutes until crust shows slight coloring in a very hot oven (see note).
5. Then bake about 30 minutes longer.

**Suggested Variations and Adjustments**
----------------------------------------

* To make the dumplings more indulgent, serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
* For an extra crunchy topping, sprinkle some cinnamon sugar on top of the pastry before baking.
* If you prefer a sweeter syrup, adjust the amount of water to your taste.
* Experiment with different spices, such as nutmeg or allspice, for added depth of flavor.

Note: Baking in a very hot oven (425°F/220°C) will help the crust brown quickly. However, keep an eye on the dumplings to prevent overcooking.
