Reformat it into Ingredients and Directions like a standard recipe, in Markdown.

Add a paragraph or two of introduction describing the recipe, and at the bottom add suggested variations or adjustments. Be positive!

Use common sense to fix any errors (like 60 eggs or 3 gallons of vanilla extract).
