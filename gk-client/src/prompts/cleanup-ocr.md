# Pam's Juicy Fruit Cake 🍰🍓

This is a simple and delicious recipe that's perfect for any occasion. It's easy to make and can be customized with your favorite fruit.
The batter is light and fluffy, and the topping is sweet and refreshing. This recipe is sure to be a hit with your family and friends!
Consider pairing it with a scoop of ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream, especially for a hot summer day! 🍨🍓

## Ingredients

### For the batter

- 1 cup of flour
- 1/2 cup of sugar
- 1/4 cup of butter
- 2 eggs
  
### For the topping

- Your favorite fruit
- Whipped cream

## Instructions

- Mix the flour and sugar together in a bowl.
- Add the butter and eggs, and mix well.

> 🥄 Be careful not to overmix the batter, as this can form additional gluten, which will make the cake tough.
> Sifting the flour will not change this much, but you can opt for cake flour
> (which has less gluten-forming protein) for a lighter crumb if you prefer.

- Pour the mixture into a baking dish and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.
- Let cool and serve with your favorite topping.

> 🧊 Fruit can be fresh or frozen, depending on what's in season.
> If it's frozen, it may produce more liquid, so consider using less fruit to avoid drowning your cake.

## Variations

- **Gluten-free**: Use almond flour instead of regular flour. The crumb will be a bit different, but it's still delicious! 😋
- **Vegan**: Use a plant-based butter substitute and a flax egg. This will make the dish denser, so consider adding a bit of baking powder to lighten it up.
- **Chocolate**: Add a handful of chocolate chips to the batter before baking. This will make the dish richer and more decadent.
- **High altitude**: Increase the baking temperature by 25 degrees and reduce the baking time by 5 minutes. This will help the dish rise properly at high altitudes.
