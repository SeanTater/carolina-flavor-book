Don't be surprised if this becomes your new go-to dessert to impress family and friends.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 box of chocolate cake mix
* 1 cup cooked chocolate pudding (see notes)
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1 1/3 cups milk
* 1 stick of Olio (or substitute with a neutral-tasting oil, such as canola or vegetable oil)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Chocolate chips for topping (about 1 cup)

**Directions:**

1. Preheat your oven to the temperature indicated on the chocolate cake mix box.
2. Mix together the cake mix and cooked chocolate pudding according to the instructions on the box.
3. Pour the batter into a greased and floured pan (9x13 inches).
4. Bake for the recommended time, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
5. While the cake is baking, melt 1 stick of Olio and 1 cup of chocolate chips in a saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly.
6. Once melted, add 2 cups of confectioner's sugar to the Olio and chocolate mixture. Stir until smooth.
7. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
8. Drizzle the chocolate-Olio sauce over the top of the still-warm cake.

**Suggested Variations or Adjustments:**

* For an extra-decadent treat, sprinkle chopped nuts (such as almonds or walnuts) over the top of the cake before serving.
* If you're feeling adventurous, try substituting the chocolate pudding with a different flavor, like caramel or strawberry.
* To make this recipe even more indulgent, serve warm with a scoop of ice cream!
