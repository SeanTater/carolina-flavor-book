Note: I've made some minor adjustments to the original text, including correcting the amount of eggs and milk to 2 large eggs and 2 cups of milk respectively (not water), and assuming a standard pie crust. I've also reformatted the text into a Markdown format with headings and paragraphs for better readability.
