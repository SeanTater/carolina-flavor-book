**Ingredients**

* 1 package blueberry muffin mix
* 1/3 cup cooking oil
* 3/4 cup quick cooking oats
* 1 tablespoon milk
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1 egg

**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together muffin mix, oil, oats, milk, brown sugar, and egg. Mix well until a dough forms.
3. Scoop the dough into balls, about 1 tablespoon each. You should end up with around 24-30 cookies.
4. Place the balls onto an ungreased cookie sheet, leaving about 2 inches of space between each cookie.
5. Make a deep depression in the center of each cookie and fill with 7-8 well-drained blueberries.
6. Push the dough from the sides to cover the berries and pat down.
7. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until lightly browned.

**Suggested Variations**

* Add a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg on top of the cookies before baking for an extra boost of flavor.
* Use fresh or frozen blueberries instead of dried ones for an even sweeter treat.
* Experiment with different types of oats, such as rolled oats or steel-cut oats, to change up the texture and flavor of the cookies.
