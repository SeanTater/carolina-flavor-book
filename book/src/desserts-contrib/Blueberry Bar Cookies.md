**Blueberry Bar Cookies**
=====================================

These delicious bar cookies are perfect for a quick dessert or snack. With a crunchy oat and butter crust, a sweet blueberry filling, and a crumbly topping, they're sure to be a hit with anyone who tries them.

**Ingredients**
---------------

* 1 package of blueberry muffin mix
* 5 tablespoons of butter, softened
* 1 cup quick cooking oats
* 1/2 cup raspberry or blackberry jam or preserves
* 1 and 1/3 cups sugar (yes, you read that right - one and a half DOZEN medium bar cookies will only require 1 and 1/3 CUPS of sugar!)
* 1 cup fresh blueberries
* 1/4 cup reserved crumb mixture (see below)

**Directions**
-------------

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.
2. Wash the blueberries and set them to drain.
3. In a large bowl, combine the dry muffin mix, oats, and sugar. Cut in the butter until the mixture forms crumbs.
4. Reserve about one cup of this crumb mixture for later use.
5. Press the rest of the crumb mixture into the bottom of a greased 8-inch square pan.
6. Gently fold the drained blueberries into the jam or preserves, then spoon the mixture over the crust in the pan.
7. Spread the berry mixture evenly and top with the reserved crumb mixture. Pat it down to form an even layer.
8. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.

**Suggested Variations**
-------------------------

* Use different types of jam or preserves, such as apricot or peach, for a unique flavor twist.
* Add some chopped nuts, like almonds or walnuts, to the crumb mixture for added texture and flavor.
* If you prefer a crunchier topping, try baking the cookies for an additional 5-10 minutes.

I hope you enjoy these delicious blueberry bar cookies!
